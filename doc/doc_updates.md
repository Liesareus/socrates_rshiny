# Platform updates

* [2020-10-14] Participants that have contacts without age information are no longer removed by default, but these contacts are "ignored". If you want to remove participants with at least one missing contact age, select "Missing contact age: remove participant".

* [2020-10-05] Contacts whose ages are not given exactly will have by default their age sampled at random from the given range. If you want to use the midpoint, deselect "Age range: sample at random" 

* [2020-10-19] Updated the UN world population prospects version to enable demography data for 2020.
